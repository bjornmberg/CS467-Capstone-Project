      "longDes": "You awaken… your head swims and you hear laughter. As your vision clears, you find yourself sitting in a grand looking parlor. The walls are a rich dark wood. There is a couch opposite and a fireplace crackles along a wall to the east. Through a leaded glass window to the south you can see large trees swaying in the breeze. You are seated in a large leather armchair. You feel very heavy and your head throbs. As you sit for what feels like a long time you regain your senses. You’re about to stand when you hear laughter again. It seems to be moving rapidly in circles above and then behind you.\nSuddenly the fire blows outward and extinguishes with a gust of cold air.  The air above the couch opposite seems to get hazy, a glow green-yellow, and then before you a figure sits. It’s hard to make out his features but he looks like he was once handsome. Now gaunt, he is clothed in a tattered suit and tails. You hear a voice, it seems to fade in and out, coming from within your own head. \n'...sorry about that, I felt you were near and I could not miss this chance.' \n'...too long. I hear them, all the time. My torment must stop.' \n'...took my loves away. He must be stopped.' \n'...you have four days. If you fail...' \n'...you will be here in my stead. Forever.' \nThe figure looks at you for a moment, then seems to fade. When the figure is gone, you notice a small table near the couch, a pocket watch lying on it. To the North a doorway leads to a formal dining room. A door to the West leads to what appears to be a large foyer\n",

The armor’s hand is out-stretched and should be holding something, but it’s missing. There is also an old grandfather clock on the Eastern wall that, surprisingly, is still telling time, though you’re not sure of the actual time. There is a small door to the North. There are two larger doors to the East and West that lead to larger adjoining rooms. To the South is the front door to the house.
