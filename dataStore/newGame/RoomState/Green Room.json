As you walk into the room your vision blurs and sound washes over you. You see the Chef, yelling something, waving an axe and chasing a woman and a man about the room. The Chef is swinging an axe. The woman and man are running, screaming. Your head swims, and the scene fades. You hear a crashing sound to the South. As you regain your senses you see a glint of light on the ceiling above the bed. There is a door to the Southwest that leads back to the second floor landing. A door to the Northwest leads to the pink room. ",
