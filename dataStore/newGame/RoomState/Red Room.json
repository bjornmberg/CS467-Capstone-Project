A rocking horse stands near the window to the north. Did it move, or was it your imagination? You see a small table along the near wall upon which are some brushes and a music box. The walls here are deep blood red. To the Northeast is a door to the pink room. Through a door to the Southeast you can see the second floor landing.",
